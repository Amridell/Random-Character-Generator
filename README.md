# Random Character Generator
An extremely simple random D&amp;D 3.5 character generator

Easy to modify, written entirely in JS and JQuery.
Working on making it more scalable. After feats and skills are fully integrated, I'm hoping to add a portrait generator.
May end up redoing the entire thing in Node in a few weeks.

# Current Features and hopeful uses
Provides randomly generated:
Names, both first and last
Class
Race/Sex
Hit Points

Changes ability scores based on class. A wizard, for instance, always puts his highest into intelligence, while a fighter automatically decides between strength or dexterity, producing a wide variety of possible builds.

# Current known bugs:
Barbarian sometimes puts highest/second highest ability into charisma.
More of a lack of feature: haven't added prerequisite checking for feats yet.
